# Project Title

## **GLOCAL News**
**News for everyone, by anyone, from everywhere!**

This time around, we decided to create an online newspaper with news from around the world, where everyone can be a potential journalist and/or editor and get paid by it! We are using a peer review approach, giving a more democratic scent to the current field of online journalism.

This was a three weeks project (May 20th - June 9th).

# Deployment & GitHub

This application consists of a back-end API and a front-end Client.

The GitHub repository for the API is [here](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/Glocal_news-API) and the one for the Client is [here](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/Glocal_news-Client).

The API is deployed using Heroku on [this address](https://glocal-news.herokuapp.com/).

The client, which is where everything happens, is deployed via Netlify [here](https://glocal-news.netlify.com/).

# Tests, Test Coverage & CI

### API
The API part of the application was request and unit tested using [Rspec](https://rspec.info/).

To be able to run the tests, run `bundle install` in your terminal as soon as you fork this repository.

You must also have the database migrations in place, in order for everything to work properly. So in your terminal run `rails db:migrate`. In case this command produces an error, you can run `rails db:drop db:setup`.

After that, use `bundle exec rspec` to run all tests avoiding any conflicts with the gems of this repo and your locally installed gems.

Unit and request tests can be found in the `spec/models` and `spec/requests` folders respectively.

[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) was used to measure the API's test coverage.

[Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/) was used for continious integration.

### CLIENT
The Client part of the application was acceptance tested using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and component tested using [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme).

To be able to run the tests, run `npm install` in your terminal as soon as you fork this repository.

After that, use `npm run cy:open` to launch a local server instance of the application and run all acceptance tests of Cypress. To run the component tests you can use `npm run test`.

Acceptance and component tests can be found in the `cypress/integration` and `src/__tests__` folders respectively.
